~~~ Gentrack Project ~~~~

Files includes:
README - this file.
Maze.java - Defines a Maze class
GentrackProject.java - Software driver
tests - Directory consists of tests

How to run this software:

1. Extract Maze.java, GentrackProject.java, tests to a folder.
2. Edit path of tests folder according (line 81 in GentrackProject.java)
3. Compile both Maze.java and GentrackProject.java using JRE 9.
   (the Main is found in GentrackProject.java.)
4. Run!

Theoretical debate:
Let us analysis the complexity of this programme.
Let m, n be the dimensions of the maze respectively.
The programme consists of three steps:
- It iterates over the maze matrix, assigning all characters - O(m*n)
- Path finder, iterates recursively upon all vertices in the maze,
  "touches" each vertex once utmost. Temporal complexity is, thus, O(m*n)
- In case path is found, the programme iterates over all vertices
  once more in order to print them. Again this procedure is O(m*n).
Overall, the complexity of the programme is O(m*n) at the worst case.
